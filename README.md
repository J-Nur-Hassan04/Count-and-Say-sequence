# Count-and-Say-sequence

Problem statement:

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1
11
21
1211
111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.

11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.

21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

That means every integer (repeated continuously) is read off with its count value.
